1. A VPC
2. 3 Subnets

## Getting Started

Note: You will need both git and terraform commands installed. You will also need AWS access. The simplest way is to set an environment variable with your ```AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``` and ```AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY```. The AWS credentials need to be assigned permissions to create the resources.

* ```git clone https://github.com/loujaybee/terraform-aws-networking-exercises```
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply` â€” Create the infrastructure
